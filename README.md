# orchestra-jh

This is a fork of [Orchestra](https://github.com/AbdallahHemdan/Orchestra), a python package for OMR (opetical music recognition) by [Abdallah Hemdan](https://github.com/AbdallahHemdan), [Adel Rizq](https://github.com/AdelRizq), [Ahmed Mahboub](https://github.com/Mahboub99) and [
Kareem Mohamed](https://github.com/kareem3m) (available under [MIT License](https://github.com/AbdallahHemdan/Orchestra/blob/master/LICENSE)).

I have wrapped the project up into a module and added some features to fit my needs. Notably:

- [ ] Exporting more data (export coordinates of each event).
- [ ] Export to IIIF manifest.
